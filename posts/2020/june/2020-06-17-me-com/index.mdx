### Well I did the thing, I made a personal site ðŸŽ‰

I'm looking forward to adding some (hopefully) interesting articles here some day. Until then it will just function as an elaborate to way to get to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenbradley93/) ãƒ½(Â°ã€‡Â°)ï¾‰	

The site was made using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform). Initially I had set up a basic CI/CD pipeline for deploying to Heroku. But then I realized that Heroku apps can connect directly to [GitHub repos](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration) so I just went with that instead.

If you're looking to make your own blog site using Gatsby, the Gatsby documentation and tutorials are pretty good. I also got a lot of help from this tutorial by Scott Spence on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-developer-blog-from-scratch-with-gatsby-and-mdx/). It has everything you need to make a blog site.
