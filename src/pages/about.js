              <p>Stephen here. I'm originally from Ireland - the middle bit. 
                I studied at Trinity College Dublin where I got my BA in Computer Science, Linguistics, 
                and German.
              </p>
              <p>
                After interning for a year at Microsoft Ireland doing cool computational linguistics
                things, I found myself in America on a year-long Visa. And as it turns out, I haven't 
                left yet. I've been working as a SharePoint
                consultant for the past few years. I've focused mostly on front-end customizations within SharePoint 
                but my work also involves creating workflows and automation scripts. I work mostly with React, 
                Node, and Typescript but enjoy dabbling in new frameworks and languages. I also have a 
                secret love for Python.
              </p>
              <p>
                My short term goal is to become a slick front-end dev and develop cool user experiences.
                Down the line I'd like to become a fullstack engineer and work on applications
                in fields I care about - <span style={{color:'green'}}>green energy</span>, sustainability üåç, <i>the arts, </i>
                <span style={{color:'white',backgroundColor:'black'}}>science.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                In my spare time I enjoy finding new music and weird movies, and also playing games
                and all that other nerdy jazz. I also discovered recently that running is surprisingly fun
                (who'd have known).
