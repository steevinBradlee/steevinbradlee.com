            <p>Stephen here. I'm originally from Ireland - the middle bit. 
              I studied at Trinity College Dublin where I got my BA in Computer Science, Linguistics, 
              and German.
            </p>
            <p>
              After interning for a year at Microsoft Ireland doing cool computational linguistics
              things, I found myself in America on a year-long Visa. And as it turns out, I haven't 
              left yet. I've been working as a SharePoint
              consultant for the past few years. I've focused mostly on front-end customizations within SharePoint 
              but my work also involves creating workflows and automation scripts. I work mostly with React, 
              Node, and Typescript but enjoy dabbling in new frameworks and languages. I also have a 
              secret love for Python.
            </p>
            <p>
              My short term goal is to become a slick front-end dev and develop cool user experiences.
              Down the line I'd like to become a fullstack engineer and work on applications
              in fields I care about - <span style={{color:'green'}}>green energy</span>, sustainability üåç, <i>the arts, </i>
              <span style={{color:'white',backgroundColor:'black'}}>science.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time I enjoy finding new music and weird movies, and also playing games
              and all that other nerdy jazz. I also discovered recently that running is surprisingly fun
              (who'd have known).
