              <p>Stephen (not with a V) here. I'm originally from Ireland, somewhere in the middle. 
                I studied Computer Science, Linguistics, and German at Trinity College Dublin,
                where I got my Bachelor (first-class honours baby üíØ).
              </p>
              <p>
                After interning for a year at Microsoft Ireland doing cool computational linguistics
                things, I found myself in America on a year-long Visa. And as it turns out, I haven't 
                left yet (don't worry I'm here legally). I've been working as a SharePoint
                consultant for the past few years, mostly focusing on front-end and any custom
                development. I work mostly with React, Node, and Typescript but enjoy dabbling in new 
                frameworks and languages. I also have a secret love for Python but haven't really used
                it for my career...yet. 
              </p>
              <p>
                My shorter-term goal is to become an uber proficient front-end dev and work on cool user experiences.
                Down the line I want to become the full-stack full package and work on applications
                in fields I care about - <span style={{color:'green'}}>green energy</span>, sustainability üåç, <i>the arts, </i>
                <span style={{color:'white',backgroundColor:'black'}}>science.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                In my spare time I enjoy finding new music and weird movies, and also playing games
                and all that other nerdy jazz. I also discovered recently that running is surprisingly fun
                (who'd have known).
